## Comprehension Check: Practice with Machine Learning, Part 1

The following questions all ask you to work with the dataset described below.
The reported_heights and heights datasets were collected from three classes taught in the Departments of Computer Science and Biostatistics, as well as remotely through the Extension School. The Biostatistics class was taught in 2016 along with an online version offered by the Extension School. On 2016-01-25 at 8:15 AM, during one of the lectures, the instructors asked student to fill in the sex and height questionnaire that populated the reported_heights dataset. The online students filled out the survey during the next few days, after the lecture was posted online. We can use this insight to define a variable which we will call type, to denote the type of student, inclass or online.
